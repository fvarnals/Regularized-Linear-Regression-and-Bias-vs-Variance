# Machine Learning - Logistic Regression Exercise

#### <em>'Implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties.'</em><br>
  
##### In the first half of the exercise, we implement regularized linear regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir. In the next half, we go through some diagnostics of debugging learning algorithms and examine the effects of bias vs variance.

Files that I had to write code to:<br>
<strong><em>linearRegCostFunction.m</em></strong> - Regularized linear regression cost function<br>
<strong><em>learningCurve.m</em></strong> - Generates a learning curve<br>
<strong><em>polyFeatures.m</em></strong> - Maps data into polynomial feature space<br>
<strong><em>validationCurve.m</em></strong> - Generates a cross validation curve<br>
